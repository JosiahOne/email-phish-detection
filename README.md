# email-phish-detection
PoC repo used for tracking work on detecting phishing emails using ML on Thunderbird

## Notice

This repo contains many examples of phishing emails. Although they may spoof
an actual site (Google, Dropbox, etc.) all links point to example.com/<stuff>

These phishing emails were created for research purposes in order to improve
detection algorithms. If other people use them for malicious purposes, that's on
them, not me.
